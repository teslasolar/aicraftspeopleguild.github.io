## Workflows

- **W1 — Paper submission** — PR / Google Form / HTML form → auto-index → review → merge
- **W2 — Ritual experiment** — proposal → publish → post-period writeup
- **W3 — Member onboarding** — manifesto sign → profile PR → roster update

Each is driven by `.github/workflows/paper-index.yml` (L1 event) →
`build.sh` (L3 dispatcher) → PackML processes (L2) → `/api/*.json`
(L4 publication).
